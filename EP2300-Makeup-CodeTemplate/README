EP2300 Project README
======================
This project is based on PeerSim (http://peersim.sourceforge.net/). It expends
PeerSim to provide a framework for evaluating protocols for distributed monitoring.

It uses java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation to measure the size of protocol messages. 
After normal compilations, to run the code use the following command, assuming that 
(1) you run from the project root and (2) 'bin' is a folder you store your compiled Java classes.

java -cp libs/djep-1.0.0.jar:libs/jep-2.3.0.jar:bin -ea -javaagent:libs/sizeobj.jar peersim.Simulator main.cfg

======================
Configuration files:
RateControl.cfg:    for task1, change r for different message rate
Ext1.cfg:           for task2, change e for different error objectives
Ext2.cfg, Ext3.cfg: for task3, change e for different error objectives. Ext2.cfg
                    is for policy 1 and Ext3.cfg is for policy 2.

In Eclipse, please include javaagent in run configuration
