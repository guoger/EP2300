EP2300 Project README
======================
This project is based on PeerSim (http://peersim.sourceforge.net/). It expends
PeerSim to provide a framework for evaluating protocols for distributed monitoring.

It uses java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation to measure the size of protocol messages. 
After normal compilations, to run the code use the following command, assuming that 
(1) you run from the project root and (2) 'bin' is a folder you store your compiled Java classes.
